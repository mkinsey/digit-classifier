# Notes for presentation

R is a functional language, so it has immutable objects. This means that when you change the state of an object or append an item to a list object, R actually creates a new object. This can be very computationally expensive if you are not careful. Rather than writing loops, use the apply function to apply a function to each value of a collection.
