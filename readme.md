# Exploration in classification using MNIST data

## Objective

The aim of this project is to predict handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. For this 
project, the data representing one image comes in the form of 784 values, 
making a 28 by 28 pixel image. Each of the values can range between 0 and 255. 

By building a matrix and using R's `image` function, we can visualize the provided data. Here is a random row from the dataset:

This project was inspired by the Digit Regognizer [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data).

## LDA

Linear Discriminant Analysis projects the vectors into a subspace that maximizes the between class variance. This projection can then be used as a naive classifier. Let us examine the effectiveness of this approach...
