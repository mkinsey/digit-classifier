# Exploration in classification using MNIST data

## Objective

The aim of this project is to predict handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. For this 
project, the data representing one image comes in the form of 784 values, 
making a 28 by 28 pixel image. Each of the values range between 0 and 255.

This project was inspired by a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data).
